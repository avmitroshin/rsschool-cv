          Since high-school, I wanted to become of some sort of IT-engineer. For family reasons I dropped out 
          of an University and not finished my education. But I really wanted to start my career in IT. 
          And after working at small IT-companies, which offered services for IT-outsourcing, I got a job in a 
          small bank as a system administrator. I was fully satisfied with this position at first, - I learned 
          a lot. But very soon I hit the ceiling.

          Working in banking I started write scripts and so on. With time, I opened for myself the WWW 
          technologies which turned it upside down my views on IT environment. WWW revealed to me an 
          universal way to converge things, were seemed incompatible before.
