## Summary
Since high-school, I wanted to become of some sort of IT-engineer. For family reasons I dropped out of an University and not finished my education. But I really wanted to start my career in IT. And after working at small IT-companies, which offered services for IT-outsourcing, I got a job in a small bank as a system administrator. I was fully satisfied with this position at first, - I learned a lot. But very soon I hit the ceiling.

Working in banking I started write scripts and so on. With time, I opened for myself the WWW technologies which turned it upside down my views on IT environment. WWW revealed to me an universal way to converge things, were seemed incompatible before.

My goal is to gain skills that will allow me to do my daily work challenges much better.
